                -Durban(iTheku), formerly known as Port Natal, is the largest city of KwaZulu-Natal province. I am a
                summer baby, I cannot stand cold so Durban is the ultimate holiday destination because the
                weather is always good. The sunny weather, warm Indian Ocean, and warm Mozambique Current keeps Durban
                warmer than the rest of the country.

            <p class="language"> German is the most widely spoken language in the European Union – ahead of Spanish,
                French and even English. It is the official language in Germany, Austria and Liechtenstein. I would like
                to learn about the German language (also called Deutsch), because I would like to stay a
                couple of
                years in that country and save money because their curreny has a value.</p>

                    -Castle was Built by the DEIC between 1666 and 1679 and is the oldest existing colonial
                    building in South Africa.
                    -Castle of Good Hope was called a Castle because, as in the case of other Castles in
                    Europe,
                    in addition to being a defensive structure, it comprised a small community or town on
                    its
                    own.
                    The Castle was, however, not the first fort to be built at the Cape. A quadrangular
                    (four-pointed) fort was built after the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck in 1652 where the Grand
                    Parade and the main Post Office are situated today.

                <p class="built">-City hall was built on 29 August 1900 by then-mayor of Cape Town, Thomas
                    Ball,
                    and it was opened to the public in 1905.
                    The hall is mainly used for council meetings, cultural events and other significant
                    events.
                    In 1990, the Grand Parade and Cape Town City Hall hosted one of the most historic events in
                    South African history. On 11 February 1990, 250 000 people gathered on the parade to witness the
                    release of Nelson Mandela and his speech after 27 years of imprisonment on Robben Island. </p>

                <p class="built">-The building consists of three main sections: the original building,
                    completed
                    in 1884, and additions constructed in the 1920s and 1980s.
                    Parliament was burt and Zandile Christmas Mafe, a suspect accused of breaking into
                    Parliament when the fire started.
                    In the course of time, Parliament acquired many symbols of South Africa’s history, which now
                    are housed in the Parliamentary museum that is open to visitors, as are the debates and
                    proceedings themselves.</p>
